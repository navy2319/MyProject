#Shep's Little Acres Website

### Problem Statement

I will create a website application for "Shep's Little Acres". This would be an overview
of what it is today, including family members bio's and pictures, actual platt map of the 
farm from 1960. It will include the farm History, how it all started, a full history of everything 
they know today (pictures, farming, camp, canoe, hunting, 4-wheeler, sledding, etc.
Crop season - picking corn and beans, cutting hay and maintenance.
Equipment - A list with small description of all the farm machinery and when or how it was used.
Past photos of raising livestock.
Local events taking place in Clayton County.
